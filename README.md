# Node.js Design Patterns Exercises Solutions

This Git repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book "Node.js Design Patterns" by Mario Casciaro.

## About the Book

"Node.js Design Patterns" is a comprehensive guide to writing modular, reusable, and maintainable Node.js applications. The book covers various design patterns and best practices for building scalable, efficient, and robust Node.js applications.

## About the Solutions

The solutions in this repository cover the exercises in the book, organized by chapter. Each solution is a separate Node.js project that implements the exercise and demonstrates the use of the design pattern covered in the chapter.

## Installation

To run the solutions, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Once you've installed Node.js and npm, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/gabrielpalomino/nodejs-design-patterns-exercises.git


After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory of the solution you want to run and install the dependencies using npm:

npm install

You can then run the solution using index.js and the appropiate arguments to the exercise.
